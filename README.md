# JavaScript globals

Auto-generated JavaScript globals for all environments.

## TODO

- [ ] Use the same format as [ESLint: Specifying Globals](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/language-options#specifying-globals)
- [ ] Add other environments in [ESLint: Specifying Environments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/language-options#specifying-environments)
- [ ] Setup GitHub Workflow to auto-generate and publish to NPM

## Why?

[confusing-browser-globals](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/confusing-browser-globals/index.js) inside `create-react-app` project is outdated and doesn't include all the globals. and `create-react-app` itself is also outdated and deprecated.

This project aims to provide a well maintained and up-to-date list of all the globals for all the JavaScript environments.

For now, only browser globals are supported. other JavaScript environments will be added soon.
