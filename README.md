# JavaScript globals

Autogenerated JavaScript globals for all environments.

## TODO

- [ ] Add per-browser exports
- [ ] Setup GitHub Workflow to auto-generate and publish to NPM
- [ ] Add other environments like Node.js, Deno, bun etc.

## Why?

[confusing-browser-globals](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/confusing-browser-globals/index.js#L10) inside `create-react-app` project is outdated and doesn't include all the globals. and `create-react-app` itself is also outdated and deprecated.

Other JavaScript environments will also be added soon.
